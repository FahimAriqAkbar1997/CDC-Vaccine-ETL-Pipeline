## 📌 Overview
An end-to-end ETL pipeline analyzing CDC infant vaccination coverage data 
across U.S. states using **Databricks**, **PySpark**, and **Delta Lake**. 
Implements the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to 
progressively clean, transform, and aggregate raw public health data into 
actionable insights.

Built as part of a data engineering portfolio demonstrating real-world 
pipeline design aligned with Databricks best practices.

## 📊 Key Insights

### 1. Vaccination Coverage by State (December 2025)
![Chart 1](charts/chart1_vaccination_by_state.png)
- **California** leads with **40.48%** coverage — highest among reporting states
- **Louisiana** trails at **27.21%** — notably below the 33% average
- Only **3 of 6 states** exceeded the average coverage rate

### 2. Monthly Trend Analysis (Sep–Dec 2025)
![Chart 2](charts/chart2_monthly_trend.png)
- All states show a **dramatic surge from SEP → OCT** as flu season begins
- Coverage growth **plateaus in NOV → DEC** suggesting early adopter saturation
- **California** shows the steepest and most sustained growth trajectory
- **South Dakota** punches above its weight relative to population size

### 3. State Rankings with Seasonal Range
![Chart 3](charts/chart3_state_rankings.png)
- **California** has the widest seasonal range (1.78% → 40.48%)
  indicating strong program ramp-up
- **Louisiana** consistently underperforms across all metrics
- Rankings shift notably between monthly snapshots vs. seasonal averages

1. **Clone this repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cdc-vaccine-etl-pipeline.git
```

2. **Upload to Databricks**
   - Import `notebooks/cdc_vaccine_pipeline.ipynb` into Databricks
   - Upload CSV to a Unity Catalog Volume

3. **Run notebook top to bottom**
   - Bronze → Silver → Gold layers execute sequentially
   - Charts render inline and save to working directory

4. **Requirements**
   - Databricks Community Edition (free)
   - Python 3.10+
   - matplotlib==3.7.1

## 🔍 Data Quality Notes

> ⚠️ **228 of 252 raw records** contained "Not Submitted" values in the  
> Numerator field with null Estimates — indicating states that did not  
> report data for that period. These were flagged and excluded in the  
> Silver layer while being fully preserved in Bronze per Medallion  
> Architecture best practices.
